                <h2>Tawanda Chimwezi</h2>
                <p class="work">
                    Hello, my name is Tawanda Chimwezi, I’m currently studying computer science at Copperstone university, in my last year. I would not say “as I was growing up I never knew I wanted to be a computer scientist or dreamt of it”.as I was growing up I always tried to open up things like toys and other things I always getting in trouble with that trait because my people would tell me I like spoiling things, little did they know that the reason was not to spoil but to understand what makes the thing work the way it does.
<br>
<br>
the toys I liked to open were motion toys they usually had motors in them, so I would open them to get the induction motors that were stored in them. It be toys like sports cars, I would get the motor and connect it to a battery to see how it runs and when I get tired of I would break it and get the magnets its has inside to play with them.
<br>
<br>

The reason I’m telling you this even although it has nothing to do with computer science is because I never really knew what
 I really wanted to be when I was young or as I growing up. My dad’s source of income was through computers it wasn’t just a job for him,
  he had passion for computers, that passion he had caught my eye. And I too wanted to know what makes him love the Job.
I had my 1st laptop in grade 6 which I was co-owner with my brother. We just played games and listened to music on it, 
I never knew it can be used for so much more. When I got into university and signed up for computer science and got to learn more 
about computers and technology. Things like networking, graphic designing and coding (programming).
<br>
<br>
 I fell in love with coding, because it is like magic especially to those who don’t know how such thing or are made. 
  Just imagine a world without computers and technology, life would be harder than it is, we would be in the stone age. 
Technology was made to make life easier for us to handle some of our day to day routines such as communication, organization of arrangements
 and information and entertainment too. The computer is just like box with cables with integrated circuit for it to work and come to life 
 and understand your commands that’s were coding comes in.
 <br>
<br>

A programmer gives the application and computer life. We let it understand your need so it can fulfil them,
 We are the ones who build the brains of any technology device and application you  use or see. And that’s why I fell in love with it.
