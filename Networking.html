                <p class="work">
                    When I was 15 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. And to love what I do.
                     Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you 
                     believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking
                     . Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.
                     <br>
                     <br>
<strong>Who is Makelele. I. Victor?</strong> A brother, Uncle, Son, a friend and a sportsman. Who is currently a Diploma holder in 
computer science, and currently upgrading to a Bachelor’s Degree. Growing up as a last born in a family of three one sister and one brother, 
with a loving mother and special friend Francis.M. I always look up to my elder’s success in Academic who are currently both Bachelor’s Degree holders, 
my sister who is Accountant and my brother a H.R Engineer.
<br>
<br>
I developed interest in computers at the age of 10, it was love at first sight with technology. Was a big fan of Billy Gates and Steve Jobs, I recall each time when everyone home had difficulty with the Computer and they could call me to help, little did I know that one day I will find myself in the world of technology!
With the little knowledge I had about computing not knowing that computing its not about connecting the computer online or playing video games,
 it’s about changing, creating, solve computing problems and designing.
 <br>
 <br>
Finally, I had the chance to pursue computer science, during my time in University
 I came across different Principal areas of Computer Science such as artificial intelligence, computer systems
  and networks, security, human computer interaction and numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering,
   bioinformatics and theory of computing etc.
Although knowing how to programming essential to the study of computer science, I was so into field the Networking and Security.
<br>
<br>
Computer security is a field of computer technology with an objective of protecting information from unauthorized access,
disruption, or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users.
And the field computer networking is a process of connecting two more or computers with the purpose to share data,
 provide technical support, and to communicate. Internet is the technology that is used to connect different
  computer systems (located in different geographic location).
  <br>
  <br>
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, this has been my journey of in the world of computing.
 I thank God for the journey of life and for great people in my life.
